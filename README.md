# arduino_orchard_watering
This is a project to water my urban orchard using an arduino.
The main characteristics are the following ones:
* An electro-valve controls the watering. It is connected to the arduino and to the energy supply.
* The watering of the plants is done at sunrise and 3h before sunset. The watering time is calculated based on equations from Astronomical Algorithms, by Jean Meeus, it requieres the local latitude and logitude and the current day.
* An device to mesure the humidity and temperature is also connecteed to the arduino.
* An LCD display to show information.
